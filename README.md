# Get Started

```npm install```

```npm run start```

This will build:

1) the scss and put it in _site/src/css
2) The HTML and build pages, in this case index.html


This sample uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to scaffold a simple html templating structure to demo how a header component and hero component could be used.

For going forward you can either use:
1) The html generated in _site,
2) or you can integrate your PHP/JS for data retrieval into _data and this will be mixed into the HTML code at build time
