# Get Started

```npm install```

```npm run start```

This will build:

1) the scss and put it in _site/src/css
2) The HTML and build pages, in this case index.html


This sample uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to scaffold a simple html templating structure to demo how a header component and hero component could be used.
